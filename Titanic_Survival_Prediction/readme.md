# Titanic Survival Prediction

Predict survival of passengers on the Titanic using Machine Learning.

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)
- Features: Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked, FamilySize, IsAlone

## Project Description
- Preprocessed missing values for Age and Embarked
- Engineered new features: FamilySize, IsAlone
- Encoded categorical variables
- Scaled features for better model convergence
- Trained Logistic Regression to predict survival

## Results
- Accuracy: ~80%
- Includes confusion matrix and classification report
- Ready for extension with Random Forest / XGBoost for higher accuracy

Optional: Try **Random Forest or XGBoost** for 82â€“85% accuracy. 
## How to Run
```bash
python titanic_ml_improved.py
